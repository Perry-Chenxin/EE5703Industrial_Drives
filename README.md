This is the assignment and project of ee5703 industrial drives, which mainly focus the DFIG modeling (doubly-fed induction generator converters wind turbine).


The group project on dfig study includes vector control (is+ir & psis + ir), pmsg vs dgig and power control (this part not in repository). 


We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our professor Prof Ashwin. M. Khambadkone for his invaluable guidance and patient throughout this course. His expertise and teaching plays a important roles in deepening our understanding of industrial drives and enhancing our skills in this field. Furthermore, we benefited a lot for the emphasis on learning from first principles, which will have a lasting impact in our lifelong learning journey. Finally, I would also appreciate my teamates Limin and Xuanyu for spending days discussing and brainstorming, we had a good time in learning from each other.
